# Deep Research Report: Post-Launch Retention Analysis

## Research Question
How well is Season 3 retaining the launch week surge, and what predicts long-term engagement?

## Key Metrics

### Retention Funnel
- Day 1 → Day 7: 45% retention
- Day 7 → Day 14: 72% retention (projected)
- Compared to Season 2 launch: +12% improvement

### Cohort Analysis
| Cohort | D1 Retention | D7 Retention | Projected LTV |
|--------|--------------|--------------|---------------|
| New Players | 34% | 28% | $12 |

| Returning (3+ months) | 78% | 65% | $67 |
| Never Churned | 89% | 82% | $120 |

### Engagement Predictors
Machine learning model identified top predictors of 30-day retention:
1. **First session length** (>45 min = 3x more likely to retain)
2. **Social play** (squad games = 2.5x retention)
3. **Battle Pass purchase** (2.2x retention)
4. **Achievement unlocks** (>5 in week 1 = 1.8x retention)
